                            <p class="py-1">Stephanie Gilmore’s salty tears blended with the Pacific Ocean as she lay on her surfboard, taking a moment to contemplate
                                a sensational comeback that meant the 34-year-old Australian had become the most successful female surfer in history.
                                Claiming a record-breaking eighth world surfing title, Gilmore had it all to do when she headed to San Clemente, California last
                                week to compete in the 2022 Rip Curl WSL Finals at Lower Trestles. Rated fifth in the world going into the event, a new competition
                                format meant Gilmore had to win three consecutive heats to even get a chance of facing reigning world and Olympic champ Carissa Moore
                                for the title. But win them she did before taking on the American in a best-of-three showdown.

                            <p class="py-1">World No1 Iga Swiatek won the women's title at the 2022 US Open tennis grand slam on Saturday (10 September), defeating Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6 [7-5].
                                With her victory at Flushing Meadows in New York, the fourth and final grand slam of the year, Swiatek claimed her third Grand Slam trophy after she won the 2020 and 2022 French Open.
                                The Polish superstar raced to a dominant first-set win on the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. However, Jabeur made things complicated for the 21-year-old in a marathon second set.
                                The title, which Great Britain's Emma Raducanu won in 2021, was the first time a No1 seed won the US Open final since Serena Williams in 2014.</p>

                            <p class="py-1">Team USA’s Sunisa Lee is back to training after taking what she told Olympics.com in June was her first vacation – ever!
                                The Tokyo 2020 women's gymnastics all-around gold medallist posted a video of herself on Instagram performing a Nabieva, a toe-on to layout Tkatchev. The catch-and-release move was one of the signature elements for Lee in Tokyo.
                                Lee wrote on the post: “getting back into the swing of thingsss.”
                                The video comes after Lee has shared several training videos in recent weeks, including her performing a full-twisting double layout off a rod floor, a round off layout stepout balance beam mount, and a Jaeger-half to Ezhova uneven bars combination.
                                Lee has been keeping a busy schedule as of late, with stops at Auburn University, where she is entering her sophomore year, Minneapolis, where she trains and Los Angeles to attend a University of Southern California football game.
